	<h5 class = "intro"><b><u>About me</u></b><br/>
				I am currently working towards my Bachelor's degree for Compute Science at Indiana University, Bloomington.
				I love programming and working with hardware. Working on difficult projects is my favorite. I also enjoy
				math and working with numbers. I am always excited to learn some new language or something new that is come up!<hr/></h5>

			<h5><b><a href = "https://www.theeasyscore.com">TheEasyScore</a></b><br/>
                TheEasyScore is a website I made that has an algorithm that gives a score to each professor depending on how easy they are by looking at their track record.
                I used Python for the back end and Flask as the framework along with HTML, CSS, Javascript and some JQuery for the front end. This was a really fun project.
                More than 2000 students used this website for registering for classes. The website is now been updated with a new look with the help of another student.
